# What is the Cloud?

That is our main objective 

## Here are the 5 things we will learn:
1. Exlpore Cloud Computing
2. Compare and contrast physical, virtual, and cloud architectures
3. Differentiate between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
4. Introduction to Google Cloud compute, storage, big data, and ML services
5. Examine the Google network and how it powers cloud computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Ccomputing is a way of using information technology that has these five equally important traits:

1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet
3. The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
4. The resources are elastic which means they can increase or decrease as needed
5. Customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go

# What is Cloud Architecture?
#### Cloud v. Traditional architecture

Cloud computing came in waves:
- First wave: saw colocation, which meant there were large private data centers that housed user data
- Second Wave: which is a virtualized data center, mainly is just what the first wave is on an online scale. 
The components of VDCs (Virtualized Data Centers) match that of the first wave, it has its servers and cpus but just
on a virtul scale. 
- Third Wave: As businesses grow, they need to expand. There come container based architecture, which is a fully automatic
third wave cloud that consists of automated services and scalable data. 

### Fun fact: Roughly all Data Centers in the world use up 2% of the worlds electrcity

# Cloud Service Offerings 
#### IaaS & PaaS

IaaS: Known as, Infrastructure as a service
PaaS: Platform as a service

##### IaaS:
- Raw Compute
- Storage
- Network Capabilities
- Mimics Virtual Data Center structure
##### PaaS:
- You pay for what they use
- Provides code to libraries that provide access to what applications need
- Allows more resources on application logic


## Evolution of Cloud Computing 
Momentum has shifted into managed resources and managed service as products and services rely more and more on speed and reliability. These allows more focus on customer needs. 

> Then theres serverless computing, which has no infrastructure management and is more centered on development

##### SaaS: Software as a Service
- These include tools like gmail and google services. These are basically software services that run on the cloud

# Google Cloud Architecture

Here are some of the Google Cloud Computing Services that assist with its Architecture:
- Compute Engine
- Google Kubernetes Engine
- App Engine
- Cloud Run
- Cloud Run Functions

Then we have storage services such as:
- Cloud Storage
- Relational Databases: CloudSQL, Spanner
- NoSQL databases: Bigtable, Firestore

##### Lets Explore the Network Security Block

Google has multiple cloud infrastructure locations, throughout most of the continents. Then there are regional data blocks in which each region has its own respective block. Then in each region, there are multiple zones. 

It goes:
- Location
- Regions
- Zones

*Google Cloud resources are deployed in zones*
