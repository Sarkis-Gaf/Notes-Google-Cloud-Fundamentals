#### Compute Options
- Good for general work

#### PaaS
- Use App Engine

#### Cloud Run Functions
- Serverless option to run code based on some sort of event (bot idea?)

## Exploring IaaS with Compute Engine

With Compute Engine, users can create and run virtual machines on Googles virtual datacenters and networks.
A virtual machine can run like an operating system and be configured to any of your needs. 
You can run any computing workload such as web hosting, application hosting, or backend stuff.

You can create a virtual machine using the Google cloud console. 

##### Peremptible CPUs
- Can help save you 90% on VM & vCPU costs for workloads that does not require a human to sit there and inspect it.
- You can use Google cloud online price calculator to check how much your task can cost
