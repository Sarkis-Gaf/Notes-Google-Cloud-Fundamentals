# Computing Foundations in Data Mining, Machine Learning, & Big Data w/ Google Cloud

## Introduction to big data managed services in the cloud

#### Here is how big data is stored/managed
- Dataproc: processes big data with Hadoop/Spark
- Dataflow: Analyze streaming data in real-time
- BigQuery: Modernize a data warehouse foundation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Leveraging big data operations with Dataproc
Dataproc is a managed service for Spark and Hadoop, which are open-source data processing software.
Dataproc allows you to create clusters easily, it is cost-effective, fast, and scalable, and it has an open-source ecosystem

Lets see its use case in ML:
Let's say that someone is using Spark machine learning libraries (Mlib) and are using it to run classification algorithms on large datasets

You can install Spark & MLib on any dataproc cluster and you can use cloud monitoring to monitor workflows
